# Country quiz

Country Quiz is a small question and answer game that allows users to test their knowledge about flags and capitals of countries through a series of questions.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating "Country Quiz" was to improve my skills in frontend development.

Additionally, I was curious to explore the world of frontend testing. By incorporating tests, I wanted to ensure that the game functioned as expected, and also to create tests from a user's perspective.

Lastly, to complete the [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/).
